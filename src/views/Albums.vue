        The band distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of
        their previous album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bends_(album)">The Bends</a>.
        OK Computer's abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences
        laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more

        In Rainbows is the seventh studio album by the English rock band
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>. It was
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-publishing">self-released</a>
        on 10 October 2007 as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want">pay-what-you-want download</a>,
        followed by a physical release internationally
        through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XL_Recordings">XL Recordings</a>
        in December 2007 and in North America through
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TBD_Records">TBD Records</a> on 1 January 2008. It was
        Radiohead's first release after their recording contract with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI">EMI</a> ended with their album
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_to_the_Thief">Hail to the Thief</a>
        (2003).

        Radiohead began work on In Rainbows in early 2005. In 2006, after initial recording sessions with new producer
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Stent">Spike Stent</a>
        proved fruitless, the band toured Europe and North America, performing the new material. After
        re-enlisting longtime producer
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Godrich">Nigel Godrich</a>,
        Radiohead recorded in the country houses

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_House">Tottenham House</a>,
        Godrich's London studio, and Radiohead's Oxfordshire studio. In Rainbows is more personal than
        previous Radiohead albums, with singer
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Yorke">Thom Yorke</a>
        describing it as "seduction songs". Radiohead incorporated
        a variety of styles and instruments, using electronic instruments, strings, piano, and the
